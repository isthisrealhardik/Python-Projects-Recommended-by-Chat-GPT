"# Python-Projects-Recommended-by-Chat-GPT" 

Here i'll be doing Projects Recommended by Chat GPT to go from a beginner stage to an advanced sort of?

Beginner?
- A Number Guessing Game (you can choose the range, and the computer will prompt you untill get the number right)
- Calculator (you can choose how many numbers you'd like to operate on as well as what operation)
- Rolling Dice Game (a basic function that uses the random library to return a random output ranging from 1 to 6)
